            <h1>Virtual</h1>
            <p>A virtual classroom environment ensures human connection, a vital element of classroom teaching that video-on-demand courses donâ€™t have and sorely miss. In a virtual classroom, teachers interact with students in real time; students can voice their questions and interact with peers similar to how they would in a regular classroom, albeit over the internet.</p>

            <h1>In Person</h1>
            <p>Face-to-face learning is an instructional method where course content and learning material are taught in person to a group of students. This allows for a live interaction between a learner and an instructor. It is the most traditional type of learning instruction.</p>
